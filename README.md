# Owe-Go

[Owe-Go Client Code](https://github.com/chelsealelrod/owego_client)


### Motivation

Owe-Go was created to help individuals - myself included - who struggle to keep track of monthly bill due dates. This app isn't tied to any banking info; it's simply designed to organize bill details like due dates, amounts, and payment status.

Some users have their bills set to auto-pay, while others handle payments manually each month. With Owe-Go, users can easily create and manage a list of bills, check whether they're paid or unpaid, and categorize or tag them for better organization. Notes can also be added to individual bills for extra content.

By simplifying how bills are tracked and viewed, Owe-Go helps reduce the mental clutter and time spent digging through apps or bank statements.

I created this application using Python, Django as well as Javascript and React.
CSS for Styling.
