# Owe-Go

[Owe-Go Client Code](https://github.com/chelsealelrod/owego_client)

I wanted to create an application that helps those, including myself, who have trouble keeping up with their due dates of monthly bills. This app
does not require any banking info and is solely just for keeping track of the dates, amounts, and status of being paid.
Some people have their bills automatically taken out each month, and others may pay it manually every month. In the app, a user can check the
status of paid or unpaid by creating all your bills that you want to view and check on. Click "Create Bill" to add the bills you want to keep track of. The user has the option to add related notes to each bill as well as create categories and tags for each one. Organizing and keeping track of current bills eases the mind and saves the hassle of looking them up in indvidual
apps or bank statements.

I created this application using Python, Django as well as Javascript and React.
CSS for Styling.
